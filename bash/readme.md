### bash README source Folder
Welcome to the “README” folder for this bash repository!

Overview
The README files in this folder contain important information on how to use and interact with the bash scripts in the repository. These scripts are designed to help you automate common tasks in your Linux environment.

Repository and Gist Mappings
To map a bash script to a repository or Gist, you can use the REPOSITORY_MAPPING and GIST_MAPPING environment variables, respectively.

Here’s an example of how to set these variables in your repository:

css
Copy code
env:
  REPOSITORY_MAPPING: >-
    {
      "bash/debian-bullseye-upgrade-script.sh": "brettjrea/Debian_Bullseye_Upgrade_Script",
      "bash/ubuntu-jammy-upgrade-script.sh": "brettjrea/Ubuntu_Jammy_Upgrade_Script",
      "bash/install-nvm.sh": "brettjrea/Debian_Install_NVM"
    }
  GIST_MAPPING: >-
    {
      "bash/debian-bullseye-upgrade-script.sh": "9ac25d27f568138c0f505b0d83dfdfa5",
      "bash/ubuntu-jammy-upgrade-script.sh": "e31a45b3818a2750f39625e620824d47",
      "bash/install-nvm.sh": "e566a998d102ea2c2b8220c9c585e438"
    }
To add a new script to the mappings, simply add a new key-value pair to the REPOSITORY_MAPPING or GIST_MAPPING object, where the key is the path to the script, and the value is the name of the repository or Gist ID where the script should be mapped.

By mapping your scripts to repositories or Gists, you can easily manage and share your bash code with others.

Thank you for using this repository!
